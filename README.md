ActionBarSherlockDemo
=====================
This is a Demo Application that uses ActionBarSherlock.

Currently I am using this to show how to implement this feature even though the Android Support v7 library has 
the AppCompat ActionBar back to Gingerbread or Android 2.3

This Application will continue to get more complex and implement more native Android behavior as I progress with it. 

Eventually I will set up a service to practice consuming data from a RESTFul service.
